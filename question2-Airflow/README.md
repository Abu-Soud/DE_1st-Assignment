docker cp ./sql.sql postgres:/file.sql
docker cp ./Employees.csv postgres:/file.csv
docker exec -u postgres postgres psql postgres postgres -f /file.sql
docker exec airflow_web mkdir -p /home/airflow/data

6- go to file dags that contain "dag.py" and run it

7- you can now access Airflow on "localhost:8080"
then you will have "Post2Mongo" DAG , run it

8- you will find the json file in the data file, you can also access the mongo-express on port 8081 to see
